# Store

This is a Store Managing App, this is a prototype only
The program is continually being develop until I make it into an app
I started from using Basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS
Then I add NODE.js in the second version
Then lastly I add JQUERY and a Database in the third version which is currently the update version of the Store Managing App
